        <p>
            Paragraph 1.
            This paragraph has the normal behavior of a block-level
            element. It takes upe the entire width of the page, and the
            next element is placed underneath.
        </p>
        <p class="floated">
            Paragraph 2.
            This paragraph is floated left. The next element will be
            placed to the right of it. Now this has a width of 50%.
        </p>
        <p class="right">
            Pragraph 3.
            This paragraph now has a margin-left so it is separated from
            the previous paragraph. Its width is still automatically
            determined.
