        <h1>Emphasis and Strong Emphasis</h1>
        <p>
            This paragraph illustrates two main kinds of emphasis.
            <em>This sentence uses the em tag.</em>
            By default, emphasis is italic.
            <strong>This sentence uses strong emphasis.</strong>
            The default formatting of strong emphasis is bold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course you can change the formatting with CSS.
            This is a great example of <em>semantic</em> formating.
            Rather than indicating the <strong>formatting</strong>
            of some text, you indicate <strong>how much it is
            emphasized</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This way you can back and change things, like adding color
            to emphasized text witout the formatting commands
            muddying your actaul text.
